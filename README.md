## 🚀 Learning Go for Backend Development

Welcome to **Poprocket**, my personal learning project where I explore the Go programming language for backend development. This repository contains my daily progress, code snippets, and experiments as I dive into Go.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
GO/
│── learning/Day1/        # Daily learning progress
│── learningFromAi/       # AI-assisted learning notes and code
│── README.md             # This file
│── go.mod                # Go module file
│── main.go               # Main entry point
```

## 🔥 Why Go?
- High performance and efficiency
- Easy concurrency with goroutines
- Strong standard library
- Popular choice for backend development

## 📖 Learning Plan
1. Basics of Go (syntax, variables, functions)
2. Working with packages and modules
3. Building REST APIs with Go
4. Database integration with Go
5. Concurrency and Goroutines

## 🚀 How to Run
To run this project, ensure you have Go installed. Then, use:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## 💡 Resources I'm Using
- [Go Official Docs](https://golang.org/doc/)
- [The Go Programming Language Book](https://www.gopl.io/)
- Online tutorials and AI-generated insights
